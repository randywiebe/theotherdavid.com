                        <p>
                            Amid posts detailing the wonders of a butterfly count, some of you who see these posts probably ask the question - who cares, what does it matter,
                            and why would ANYONE get paid money to prance around with a bug net in the first place?
                        <p>
                            While I think everyone has to admit that a butterfly count is fun, many people have no idea why we would bother. Believe it or not, there is serious science behind this whimsical activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Butterflies are more than just pretty - they are bright, countable, measurable, highly visible beacons whose numbers and diversity give us information about the regions we find them in, especially
                            when you analyze population trends over time. Yes, we want to know what species are out there, but each species also has a story. Of the ~100 possible species in our region, each has a slightly
                            different range of tolerances. Each specializes on a different set of host plants, and each is adapted to different habitat conditions, and flourishes at different times of year. Each has a different
                            tolerance level to human intrusion/disturbance, or to the vast array of chemicals we churn out into the landscape. And each is in turn fed upon by a hugely diverse array of predators. Caterpillars of
                            moths and butterflies are significant defoliators of plants, far outweighing the impacts of mere mammals such as deer. They are also crucial food for a huge array of wildlife (especially birds) -
                            basically representing a major resource bridge between plants and higher animals, turning plant leaves, stems and fruits into high-protein food. For such small things, they have significant importance on any landscape.
                        <p>
                            When we find a huge diversity of butterflies inhabiting our nature sanctuaries, including sensitive and rare species, we know we are providing enough functional ecosystems of a high enough quality to
                            support them all. They are living, flapping proof that we are moving in the right direction. The return of certain species may even indicate a turning point in restoration success - a key percent of regional
                            forest cover achieved, a key acreage of wetland restored, a key threshold of pollution level decreases, or a key level of connectivity of natural lands not seen on the landscape for decades. A loss or decline
                            of another species may indicate a systemic failure somewhere on the landscape, whether in your backyard or thousands of miles away (eg: Monarchs...). You can survey a landscape all you want - but nothing knows
                            its true natural value like the animals that live there, who live and die by its resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Butterflies certainly aren't the only signals to look for - but they are bright, clear, obvious "flags" that tell us something important about web of life we are trying to preserve. And they're right there,
                            flagging you down, waiting to be observed - the least we can do as conservationists is keep an eye out for them, even if it's only once a year.
